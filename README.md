- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @roslonieck
- ðŸ‘€ I have been interested in programming since October 2021. There is still a lot ahead of me, but it gives me incredible fun. I never thought before that IT would be the path I would take. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming in Java and C++. I would like to broaden my knowledge of the language and good practices.
- ðŸ“« To contact me, you can simply send me a message at: rosloniec@outlook.com.
